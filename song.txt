There's a picture on the wall of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer, said, "How the hell did you get there?"
Oklahoma
Mm, mm
There were flowers that were dry, sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from, I said, "A place I don't remember"
Oklahoma (oh)
Jenny jumped into the pool, she was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, "Most men don't want a woman with a legacy, it's of age"
She said, "You can't be a muse and be happy, too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry and be happy"
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who
Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint
My banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue
